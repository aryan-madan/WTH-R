# WTH/R

yes it's a pun on weather and 'what the hell' (wth)

honest weather for people who hate checking the weather.

## why

i found weather apps boring. i got tired of robotic forecasts that just show numbers. i wanted an app to convey feelings and have a mood cuz who doesnt atp, it needs to have personality and not be the same boring thing

ik minimalism isnt the most personality inducing, but the messages make up for it i swear
